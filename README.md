# Merkle Tree

This is a simple program that takes a set of contents and generates a Merkle Tree out of it.  

For example, given a set of strings ["cat", "kitten", "dog", "turtle", "dinasour"], the final result would be "catkittendogturtlediasour". If you. 

The above result is not the hash of the content. This makes it easier to demonstrate that the merkle tree is working as expected.
